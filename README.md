# Student Portal

The main objective of this system is to manage grades and modules
that a student has being enrolled. Also, we have an goal to automate
the academic process and the student as well as the secretary experience
during the course.

All the system will be implemented using a No Relational Database MongoDB
because we can easily manipulate students' and academic's information.
